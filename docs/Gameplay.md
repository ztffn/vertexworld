## Looking into forking openfront.io

Here's an overview of how OpenFrontIO achieves performant game logic and minimal hosting cost, with a focus on serving world maps and handling logic:

---

## 1. Serving Detailed World Maps

- **Map Data Storage & Optimization**: 
  - The maps are pre-generated and stored as optimized binary files (`.bin`), thumbnails (`.webp`), and mini-maps using scripts like `generateTerrainMaps.ts`. This reduces runtime computation and bandwidth.
  - Images are further compressed (e.g., using `sharp` with `.webp` at quality 45), minimizing storage and transfer costs.

- **Map Loading**:
  - On the client side, lightweight thumbnails and map data are loaded as needed, reducing memory and network usage.
  - The `GameMapImpl` class (in `src/core/game/GameMap.ts`) uses compact data structures (`Uint8Array` and `Uint16Array`) to represent terrain and game state. This makes map operations efficient and memory-light.

- **Efficient Representation**:
  - Terrain and state are stored as bit-packed arrays, and various properties (land, ocean, shoreline, etc.) are extracted with bitmasks. Lookup tables are precomputed to speed up coordinate conversions and reduce per-frame math.

## 2. Game Logic Handling

- **Centralized, Tick-Based Execution**:
  - The game uses a tick-based system (`executeNextTick()` in `GameImpl`) to process all player, AI, and world updates in batches.
  - Logic such as unit actions, alliances, chat, tile ownership, and fallout are managed by a single main loop, which makes it easy to scale and avoids redundant computations.

- **Efficient Player and Unit Management**:
  - Players, units, and their actions are managed with maps and arrays for fast access.
  - Ownership and tile updates are only processed when necessary, and updates are batched to minimize server load.

- **Minimal Server Work**:
  - The server primarily orchestrates games and relays updates, rather than constantly simulating every detail for each clientâ€”this reduces CPU and memory load, which is ideal for free-to-play hosting.

## 3. Performance and Cost

- **Static Asset Delivery**:
  - Most heavy map processing is done ahead of time, allowing the game to serve static assets (images, binaries) via cheap static hosting or CDNs.
  - Game state and logic are optimized for minimal per-tick computation, making high concurrency feasible on inexpensive servers.

- **Scalable Game Management**:
  - Server-side code (such as `GameManager` and `GameServer`) is designed to efficiently handle multiple games and clients, scaling primarily with active sessions rather than total player base.

---

**Summary:**  
OpenFrontIO is designed for minimal hosting cost and good performance by:
- Preprocessing and compressing map data.
- Using efficient binary formats and bit-packed arrays.
- Handling logic in fixed-tick batches.
- Serving most content as static files and minimizing dynamic server workload.

This architecture allows the game to be free-to-play without requiring expensive infrastructure, and the main bottleneck would be the number of active games rather than map size or detail.
