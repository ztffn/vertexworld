# Vertex World MMO Project

## 1. Project Vision & Scope

This project aims to build a large-scale, stylized 3D world with MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) resource management gameplay.

**Core Ideas:**

*   **Huge Map (Potentially Entire World):** Start with a large, procedurally generated or heightmap-based continent/region, designed for future scalability.
*   **Stylized Visuals:** Employ a low-resolution grid-line aesthetic for the heightmap mesh, achieved via shaders on dynamically loaded terrain chunks.
*   **Gameplay - MMO Resource Management:** A top-down or isometric perspective where players can place buildings, gather resources, and interact with a persistent world and other players.
*   **Level of Detail (LOD) & Chunk Loading:** The world will be divided into chunks. Chunks near the player's view will be loaded with varying levels of detail based on camera proximity.

## 2. Proposed Tech Stack

### Frontend:

*   **Rendering Engine:**
    *   **React Three Fiber (`@react-three/fiber`):** For declarative 3D scene construction using React.
    *   **`@react-three/drei`:** Essential helpers and components for R3F. ([pmndrs/drei on GitHub](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei))
*   **Build Tool & Dev Environment:**
    *   **Vite:** For fast, modern ESM-based development.
*   **State Management:**
    *   **Zustand:** Lightweight, hook-based state management for React. ([pmndrs/zustand on GitHub](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand))
*   **Animation:**
    *   **`anime.js`:** For procedural animations. ([juliangarnier/anime on GitHub](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime))
    *   *Alternatives:* `@react-spring/three` or `framer-motion` for R3F integration.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Options: Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, or Tailwind CSS.

### 3D Map Specifics & LOD:

*   **Custom LOD & Chunking System:**
    *   **Heightmap Processing:** Tiled heightmaps for the vast world.
    *   **Chunking:** Grid-based world division.
    *   **Mesh Generation:** Potentially in Web Workers for terrain chunks.
    *   **LOD Management:** Quadtree/Octree for dynamic loading/unloading and LOD switching of chunks. Grid-line shader applied here.
    *   **Instancing:** `THREE.InstancedMesh` via R3F for numerous similar objects.
    *   *Inspiration:* `surviving-maps-3d` ([Ocelloid/surviving-maps-3d on GitHub](https://github.com/Ocelloid/surviving-maps-3d)).

### Backend & Multiplayer:

*   **Language & Framework Options:**
    *   **Node.js with TypeScript:**
        *   **NestJS:** Scalable server-side applications.
        *   *Alternatives:* Express.js, Fastify.
    *   **Specialized Game Servers:**
        *   **Nakama (Heroic Labs):** Open-source, scalable game server.
        *   **Colyseus:** Open-source multiplayer game server for Node.js.
*   **Real-time Communication:**
    *   **WebSockets:** Using libraries like `Socket.IO` or built-in features of Nakama/Colyseus.
*   **Database:**
    *   **Primary (Player Data, Game State):** PostgreSQL (with PostGIS for geospatial queries) or MongoDB.
    *   **Caching/Session Store:** Redis.
*   **Architecture:** Authoritative server, state synchronization, persistence, long-term scalability considerations.

### Version Control:

*   **Git & GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.**

## 3. Development Plan - Phased Approach

1.  **Phase 1: Vertical Slice - Core Rendering (Frontend)**
    *   **Setup:** Initialize project with Vite, React, React Three Fiber, and Drei.
    *   **Terrain:** Create a single, large, procedurally generated or static heightmap-based terrain chunk.
    *   **Styling:** Implement the grid-line shader on the terrain.
    *   **Camera:** Set up camera controls suitable for a top-down/isometric view (e.g., `MapControls` or `OrbitControls` from Drei, configured appropriately).

2.  **Phase 2: Chunking & LOD (Frontend)**
    *   **Chunk System:** Design and implement a basic chunking system. Divide the initial terrain into a few manageable chunks.
    *   **Dynamic Loading:** Implement logic to load/unload chunks based on camera position (initially, a simple proximity check).
    *   **LOD Implementation:** Introduce at least two levels of detail for terrain chunks (e.g., a high-poly version when close, a low-poly or impostor when far).

3.  **Phase 3: Basic Gameplay Mechanics (Client-Side)**
    *   **State Management:** Integrate Zustand for managing UI and client-side game state.
    *   **Interaction:** Allow basic interaction, e.g., selecting a point on the terrain.
    *   **Building Placement (Mock):** Implement client-side logic for placing a simple building (e.g., a cube) on the terrain. State managed by Zustand.

4.  **Phase 4: Backend Setup & Initial Multiplayer**
    *   **Server Choice:** Select and set up a basic backend (e.g., Node.js with NestJS or Nakama).
    *   **Communication:** Implement WebSocket communication.
    *   **User Accounts:** Basic user authentication and session management.
    *   **Persistence:** Store basic player data (e.g., position, placed buildings) in a database.
    *   **Synchronization:** Synchronize the placement of a simple object across connected clients. What one player places, others see.

5.  **Phase 5: Expanding Gameplay & Features (Iterative)**
    *   **Resource System:** Design and implement resource nodes on the map and resource gathering.
    *   **Building Mechanics:** Develop more complex building types with functions.
    *   **UI/UX:** Refine the user interface for gameplay actions.
    *   **Map Expansion:** Gradually increase the size of the explorable world, refining the chunking and LOD systems.
    *   **Advanced Multiplayer:** Implement more complex interactions, trading, etc.
    *   **Optimization:** Continuously profile and optimize both frontend and backend performance.

## 4. Next Immediate Steps

1.  Initialize this `vertexworld_mmo` directory as a Git repository.
2.  Commit this `README.md`.
3.  Set up the initial Vite + React + R3F project structure within this directory.
4.  Begin implementing Phase 1: Core Rendering.
